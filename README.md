# A Clone from the game 2048

## It's a fully functional game, which implements the basic movement and tile merging

This game was made just for fun, I've written it in rust using the bevy game engine. It has the following features:

* Movement with W, A, S and D or Up, Left, Down and Right
* Merging the tiles together
* Spawning new tiles after each round

## How it looks like
